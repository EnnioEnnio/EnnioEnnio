ðŸ”­ **I'm currently working on two exciting projects:**

- At German Deep Tech Quantum: I engage in the intricate world of FinTech as a working student, focusing on algorithmic, market-neutral trading supported by machine learning with digital assets. My role involves hands-on data and software engineering tasks and extends to supporting strategic project identification and market analysis, as well as funding acquisition.
- At Mount Sinai Health System New York (via Hasso-Plattner-Institute): I am part of a pioneering team developing an interactive assistant that translates natural language into SQL, executes it on a database containing electronic health records (EHR), and analyzes the results for the users. This project aims to simplify healthcare data accessibility for medical professionals, enhancing their decision-making by providing a chat-like interface to interact with the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse.

ðŸŒ± **What I'm Learning:** 

Every project brings new challenges and unique learning opportunities. Currently, I am deepening my knowledge in large language models for natural language processing and exploring advanced data engineering techniques within the financial sector. Additionally, I am focusing on improving my skills in writing larger software projects, emphasizing high-quality code and robust software engineering practices.
